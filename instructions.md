Topic Exploration App
Objective: Build a Streamlit app that demonstrates at least 5 different widget types, with content that changes based on widget values and at least one calculation.

Time: 30 minutes



What you’ll build:

Create a file called explore.py - a Streamlit app about a topic you know well (cooking, fitness, music, travel, gaming, a hobby — anything). The topic is your choice, which makes this more fun and gives you creative freedom.



Requirements:

Use at least 5 different widget types from this list:
st.text_input(), st.number_input(), st.slider(), st.selectbox(), st.multiselect(), st.radio(), st.checkbox(), st.text_area(), st.date_input()
Content that changes based on widget values (use if/elif or conditional logic)
At least one calculation that uses widget values (e.g., a cost calculator, a rating average, a progress tracker)
Use at least two of these display elements: st.write(), st.info(), st.success(), st.warning(), st.metric(), st.code(), st.progress()
A st.title() and at least one st.header() or st.subheader()


Example ideas:

Recipe calculator: Select ingredients with multiselect, set servings with a slider, calculate total calories
Workout planner: Radio buttons for workout type, slider for duration, checkbox for warm-up, calculate estimated calories burned
Trip planner: Selectbox for destination, date_input for travel dates, number_input for budget, calculate daily budget


Deliverable: A running Streamlit app (explore.py) that demonstrates at least 5 widget types with interactive content.



Why this exercise? You’re cementing the core Streamlit pattern: widgets return values, values drive logic, logic determines what’s displayed. This is the same pattern behind every AI dashboard and tool you’ll build.
